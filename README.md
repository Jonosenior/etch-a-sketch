# etch-a-sketch
An interactive, browser-based etch-a-sketch-style game.

The idea and basic instructions comes from the Odin Project (see here https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery.


Goals:
The project is my first experiment in applying js/jquery to make a page dynamic. 

From a design point of view, I wanted the project to speak for itself, without words cluttering up the screen. I liked the idea of the user exploring without guidance, and I hope to develop this theme further in future projects.
